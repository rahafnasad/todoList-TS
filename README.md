# 📝 Typed ToDo App

**Welcome to the Typed ToDo App!** This project demonstrates how to create a simple To-Do list application using React and TypeScript. Let's dive into the setup and features! 🚀

## 🚀 Set Up the Project

1. **Create a new React project.**  
   Start by initializing a new React application using Create React App or your preferred method. 

2. **Set up TypeScript in the project.**  
   When initializing the project, select TypeScript, or configure it manually by installing the necessary TypeScript packages. 📦

## 🎨 Create the Main Components

In this section, we’ll create the essential components needed for our To-Do app. Each component will be structured for clarity and reusability.

## 📦 Implement State Management

Use React’s `useState` hook to manage the state of your To-Do items. This will help you keep track of what needs to be done! 💪
